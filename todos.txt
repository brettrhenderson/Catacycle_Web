1. Arrow heads occur on the main axes but the center of the gap should occur on the main axes
    (see two step cycle)
2. Arrow thickness limit and step size should scale with circumference
3. The little white lines between arrows
4. If user does not specify a reverse rate, default should make it irreversible (also right now if input is 0.0, the arrow is not reversible(

Scaling:
    current fig size is good for up to maybe 4 steps, in general, the range of arrows doesn't have to change with number of steps
    figure size shoudl scale with number of steps included
    one step: max raw 0.8, rate, min 0.06
    two: max 0.7, min 0.06
    three: max 0.6, min 0.06
    four: max 0.5, min 0.06

    best looking arrow size falls on 0.25, ideally, this applies to the median rate

Website User input:
    1. Number of steps
        -leads to a quick&dirty default cat cycle: irreversible arrows in black

    2. Per step
    rates (0 = irreversible), incoming/outgoing arrows (same colour & of stoichiometric thickness rel. to main arrow), colour
        -allows user to cuztomize their cycle

    3. Extra arrow generator
        -for user to generate scheme of a side reaction outside of catalytic cylce

    4. option to generate multiple cycles from the same arrow scaling
        -rather than rescaling arrows for each cycle, they can have a slow cycle next to a fast cycle in the same paper with consisten arrow size for comparison
